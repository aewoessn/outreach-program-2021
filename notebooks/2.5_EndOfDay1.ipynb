        "1. Python is a versatile programming language that is used in Google Colab notebooks.\n",
        "2. Images are just a large array of pixels that contain intensity values at each pixel.\n",
        "3. Images can be loaded into python and modified using various packages (i.e. imageio and numpy).\n",
        "4. By convolving an image with various kernels, we can achieve different image effects like blurring, sharpening or highlighting edges.\n",
        "5. Whole images can also be convolved with small features to highlight that particular feature in an image.\n",
        "6. Convolution operations can be done way more efficiently on a GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### In day 2, we will be covering what neural networks are and how to train them. We will also train two different types of neural networks to predict what digit is in an image and develop a neural network predict the age of people only by using pictures of their faces.\n",
