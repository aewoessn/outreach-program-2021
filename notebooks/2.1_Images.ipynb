        "---\n",
        "##### In the world of digital imagery, a digital image is just a two-dimensional collection of the smallest unit of an image, the _pixel_. A pixel gets its name because it is a _picture element_.  When we talk about an image, the size of the image in width and height _in pixels_ is usually specified. There is no lower limit or upper limit to the size of an image, however typical scientific images are often either 512 by 512 pixels (0.26 Megapixels), or 1024 by 1024 pixels (1.05 Megapixels). To give context to these image sizes, a 4K image is 3840 by 2160 pixels (8.3 Megapixels), and an iPhone 12 Pro takes an image containing 12 Megapixels.\n",
        "##### Finally, at every pixel within an image, an _intensity_ value associated with that pixel is used to describe how bright that pixel should be. When an image is taken, the number of possible intensity values is dictated by the _bit depth_. Many scientific images are often 8-bit, meaning that there are 2^8 (or 256 possible intensity values, ranging from 0 to 255). "

        "##### In python, matricies are typically handled using the package `numpy`. Additionally, when refering to the dimensions of an image, the first dimension corresponds to the number of rows of pixels in an image, and the second dimension corresponds to the number of columns of pixels in an image."
