This can be very useful for many applications, but an MLP does have an important downfall: spatial features.\n","##### At the end of the last notebook, we saw that the weights of a trainined MLP tended to be much larger in the center of the input image where the digits are centered, and we asked these two questions:\n","1. Do you think we would get different results?\n","2. How do you think we can get around this issue?\n","\n","##### To answer the first question, we would expect to get mostly incorrect predictions for the digit in the image, since the network was not trained on images where the digit lies near the edge on the input image.\n","##### One work around for this issue is to _augment_ the dataset by translating (or moving around), rotating, or even scaling the digits in the images. However, there are an infinite number of combinations that we could do for augmentation, resulting in an MLP that will not always be correct.\n","##### Another thing we can do, however, is _scan_ the entire image and _extract features_ that are attributed to each digit.  As we learned about in the previous notebooks, this can be accomplished with images through _convolution_. Using convolution would result in a more robust network that could handle many more cases where handwritten digits or other features are located away from the center of the image. These unique features in the image can be highlighted through the use of many small _kernels_ (or _filters_) that are initially randomly chosen, but we could update and adjust via deep learning. Additionally, features can be _pooled_ together to decide which features matter most, which is done in a _pooling layer_. This kind of feature extraction network is called a _convolutional neural network (CNN)_.\n","##### The code chunk below show an example of one convolutional _layer_ that can be used in a CNN."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"A27-YRMKQDHw","cellView":"form"},"source":["# Define some parameters for a convolutional layer\n","#@title Parameters for the convolutional layer. {run:\"auto\"}\n","number_of_filters = 9 #@param {type:\"slider\", min:1, max:20, step:1}\n","filter_size = 5 #@param {type:\"slider\", min:3, max:11, step:2}\n","\n","# Get the input image\n","input_image = mnist_data.data[0,:,:].unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0).float()\n","\n","# Define the single convolutional layer\n","conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=1,out_channels=number_of_filters, kernel_size=filter_size)\n","conv_layer.requires_grad_(False)\n","weights = conv_layer.weight\n","\n","# Show the weights (filters)\n","fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))\n","ncols = 5\n","if weights.shape[0] % ncols == 0: \n","  nrows = weights.shape[0] // ncols\n","else: \n","  nrows = (weights.shape[0] // ncols) + 1\n","\n","count = 0\n","dim_size = weights.shape[2]\n","full_image = np.zeros((dim_size*nrows,dim_size*ncols))\n","for i in range(nrows):\n","  plt.plot([-0.5,dim_size*ncols],[i*filter_size-0.5,i*filter_size-0.5],'r-')\n","  for j in range(ncols):\n","    plt.plot([j*filter_size-0.5,j*filter_size-0.5],[-0.5,dim_size*nrows],'r-')\n","    if count < weights.shape[0]:\n","      full_image[i*dim_size:i*dim_size+dim_size,j*dim_size:j*dim_size+dim_size] = weights[count,0,:,:].cpu()\n","      count+=1\n","plt.plot([-0.5,dim_size*ncols],[nrows*filter_size-0.5,nrows*filter_size-0.5],'r-')\n","plt.plot([ncols*filter_size-0.5,ncols*filter_size-0.5],[-0.5,dim_size*nrows],'r-')\n","plt.imshow(full_image)\n","plt.gca().set_title('Layer 1 filters',fontsize='x-large');\n","plt.gca().set_axis_off()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lh6z8VDOVHk9"},"source":["### Fully connected layers\n","---\n","##### Although convolutional layers are very powerful at extracting features in an image, they are unable to predict a classification like an MLP can.
